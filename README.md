# cough-escape

This is a game based on escaping from the coughing players. The numbers on a player shows its probability per 10.000* to cough. When they cough, they transfer the probability points of nearby players too. If someone has 25 probability points, they die. If you reach 25 probability points, game over. 

You are the circle with yellow dots around it. You can mouseclick around to move.

\* Probability per 10000 steps
